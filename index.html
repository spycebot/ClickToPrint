    <h3>Shannon Asked: Why is zero factorial equal to one?</h3>
    <p>The reason zero factorial (0!) is defined to be 1 might seem counterintuitive at first, but it's based on several mathematical conventions and justifications:</p>
    <h3>Mathematical Conventions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Consistency with combinatorial formulas: In combinatorics, n! represents the number of ways to arrange n distinct objects. When n = 0, there's exactly one way to arrange zero objects (i.e., do nothing). Defining 0! = 1 maintains consistency with these formulas.</li>
        <li>Extension of the factorial function: The factorial function can be extended to non-integer values using the gamma function (Γ(n + 1) = n!). Defining 0! = 1 ensures a smooth extension of the factorial function.</li>
        <li>Mathematical formulas and identities: Many mathematical formulas, such as the binomial theorem and power series expansions, rely on the convention 0! = 1 to work correctly.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Justification</h3>
    <p>Defining 0! = 1 might seem arbitrary, but it's a deliberate choice that simplifies many mathematical expressions and formulas. This convention has been widely adopted in mathematics and is now an integral part of the factorial function's definition.</p>
    <p>By defining 0! = 1, mathematicians can maintain consistency, simplify formulas, and ensure that various mathematical constructs work seamlessly together.</p>
