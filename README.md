# ClickToPrint
Toy model for working out click controlled JavaScript to set HTML element's eligibility for print.

FRI 16 MAY 2025

## Problem

For greatest effect, each job application requires a custom resume. Over the course of an extended job search, it becomes difficult to maintain a targeted resume that is both concise (limited to one page), and captures your most important skills and experience, phrased in the best possible manner. 

The current problem is a data wrangling problem.

## Data

The data inputs for the present project include, but are not limited to, the following:

1. Courseware provided by software development tutor Brian Rogers
2. Mozilla Developer Network documentation
3. Selected advice from w3schools, geeks4geets, StackOverflow, and elsewhere.

## Method

Develop the JavaScript code that will allow us to build a comprehensive curriculum vitae (CV) -- a single document that artfully describes all of our skills and experience -- that can then be used to print a resume that is limited in length to one page, while quickly and reliably highlighting the particular skills and experience that are most gemain to the present job application.

The present project is neither the CV nor the resume, but is a toy model for working out click controlled JavaScript to set HTML element's eligibility for print.
